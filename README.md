## How you should use the src:
**waring: its good to read the src one time by your self.**

1- at first download the dataset from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qY25-g_HVWJDs7Lzq5mxdDg50-wbF0Up?usp=sharing

2- after that you should train the dataset in speech_recgnition_model_trainer.py file 
  - point: if you dont have strong system train the model in colab or jupyter.

3- after train the model run the speech_recgnition_game.py and play the game.
  - warning: If you encounter false detections while running the program, it is likely that the volume of your microphone is too high, reduce it so that the ambient noise does not cause wrong detection.
