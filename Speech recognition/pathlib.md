## What is Pathlib?

Pathlib is a Python module that provides an object-oriented way of working with file paths. It is part of the Python 
standard library and was introduced in Python 3.4. Pathlib provides a high-level interface for working with file paths, 
making it easier to perform common file system operations.


## Why do we use Pathlib?

#### Pathlib is used for several reasons:

- Cross-platform compatibility: Pathlib provides a consistent interface for working with file paths across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux), making it easier to write cross-platform code.
- Improved readability and maintainability: Pathlib's object-oriented approach makes code more readable and easier to maintain, as it provides a more intuitive way of working with file paths.
- Enhanced functionality: Pathlib offers a range of additional functionality beyond the basic file path operations, such as path manipulation, file system operations, and path-related calculations.
- Compatibility with existing file system APIs: Pathlib can be used in place of the built-in os.path module, providing a more modern and user-friendly interface while maintaining compatibility with existing file system APIs.


## Advantages of Pathlib:

- Cross-platform compatibility: Pathlib handles path separators and other platform-specific details, making it easier to write cross-platform code.
- Improved readability: Pathlib's object-oriented approach makes code more readable and easier to understand.
- Enhanced functionality: Pathlib provides a wider range of functionality compared to the built-in os.path module, such as path manipulation, file system operations, and path-related calculations.
- Compatibility with existing APIs: Pathlib can be used in place of os.path, allowing for a smooth transition and integration with existing code.


## Disadvantages of Pathlib:

- Learning curve: Pathlib introduces a new way of working with file paths, which may require some time to get used to for developers who are familiar with the traditional os.path module.
- Potential performance impact: Pathlib's object-oriented approach may have a slight performance impact compared to the more lightweight os.path module, especially for simple operations.
- Limited support in older Python versions: Pathlib was introduced in Python 3.4, so it may not be available or have the same level of support in older Python versions.


## Summary about Pathlib:

Pathlib is a Python module that provides an object-oriented way of working with file paths. It offers cross-platform 
compatibility, improved readability and maintainability, and enhanced functionality compared to the built-in os.path 
module. Pathlib's advantages include its cross-platform compatibility, improved readability, and expanded functionality,
while its disadvantages include a potential learning curve and a slight performance impact. Pathlib is a useful tool for
developers who need to work with file paths in a more modern and user-friendly way, especially in the context of 
cross-platform development.
