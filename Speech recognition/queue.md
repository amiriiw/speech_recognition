## What is a queue?

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is a collection of elements 
where new elements are added at the rear (enqueue) and existing elements are removed from the front (dequeue).


## Why do we use a queue?

Queues are used in various applications where the order of processing is important, such as:

- Handling requests in a web server or operating system.
- Implementing a job scheduling system.
- Maintaining a waiting list for resources (e.g., printer, bank teller).
- Implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm in graph theory.


## Advantages of a queue:

- Maintains the order of elements: Queues preserve the order of elements, ensuring that the first element added is the first one to be removed.
- Efficient memory usage: Queues can be implemented using an array or a linked list, which allows for efficient memory usage.
- Easy to implement: Queues have a simple structure and are relatively easy to implement compared to other data structures.
- Versatile: Queues can be used in a wide range of applications, from operating systems to computer networks.


## Disadvantages of a queue:

- Limited access: Queues only allow access to the front and rear elements, making it difficult to access elements in the middle of the queue.
- Fixed size (if implemented using an array): If a queue is implemented using an array, it has a fixed size, which means that it can only hold a limited number of elements. This can lead to overflow issues if the queue becomes full.
- Slower performance for certain operations: Compared to other data structures like stacks, queues may have slower performance for certain operations, such as random access to elements.


## Summary about a queue:
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is widely used in various 
applications where the order of processing is important, such as handling requests in a web server or implementing a job 
scheduling system. Queues have several advantages, including maintaining the order of elements, efficient memory usage, 
and easy implementation. However, they also have some disadvantages, such as limited access to elements and potential
overflow issues if implemented using an array.
